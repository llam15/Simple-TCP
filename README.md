## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

## Provided Files

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` are the entry points for the server and client part of the project.
